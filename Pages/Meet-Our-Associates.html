            Jeffrey is a graduate of the University of Waterloo and holds a
            degree in Drama and Classics. He is also a graduate of the Strategic
            Coach Program’s Master Class for Entrepreneurs. His success as an
            actor/performer incrementally fuelled his entrepreneurship. He took
            a small live show, in which he starred and produced and turned it
            into a full time business. When that business grew over fifty
            employees, Jeffrey began to appreciate the importance of corporate
            training and communication and he’s been enthusiastic about sharing
            what he has learned, ever since.

            August attended Ontario Tech University where he earned an Honours
            Bachelor of Science in Physics. Upon graduation he wasn't sure what
            career to pursue and after a brief stint in manufacturing decided to
            learn web development. After roughly six months of self teaching,
            August was taken on by RTC - A Mindset Company as the lead web
            developer and is responsible for building the website you're
            currently looking at! If you have any suggestions or feedback for
            the site please contact him. August is also available for work and
            is looking for a full-time position in web development.
